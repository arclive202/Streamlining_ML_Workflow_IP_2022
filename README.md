# Streamlining Machine Learning Lifecycle to Improve Retail Sales Performance Using MLflow

## Abstract

Organizations leveraging machine learning seek to streamline their machine learning development lifecycle. Machine learning model development possesses additional new challenges as compared to the traditional software development lifecycle. These include tracking experiments, code & data versioning, reproducing results, model management, and deployment. This paper aims to describe the implementation of MLflow on Azure databricks to streamline the process of building a recommender system to predict the user preference for a product or the likelihood of the user purchasing a product, given they are targeted with coupons in a promotional campaign. Finally, the entire machine learning pipeline is integrated with Flask using Rest API to
serve the model on real-time and batch inferencing.
